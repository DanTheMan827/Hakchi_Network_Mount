# Hakchi Network Mount Mod (PRE-RELEASE)

This module will allow you to mount all your (S)NESC roms on a network share including your saves. This means you can now share your romsets and save files between multiple networked consoles!

To set up your console for networking share please follow the below video for more information:

The config file can be found in `/etc/network-mount.cfg` and if you already have a network share set up with RetroArch you can automatically use that config.

You can either FTP/Telnet to the console to modify the config or USB/SD users can place a `network-mount.cfg` file within `USB/SD:/hakchi/network-mount.cfg` and it will overwrite it on boot.
